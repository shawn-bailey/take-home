# Mobile Coding Challenge - Take Home Task

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your coding performance and to understand your attitude towards software development.

## About this repository

This is a monorepo that has 2 projects:
- [Android](https://github.com/sumup-challenges/mobile-coding-challenge-take-home-task/tree/main/Android)
- [iOS](https://github.com/sumup-challenges/mobile-coding-challenge-take-home-task/tree/main/iOS)

So please make sure to apply changes only to the domain you know the most (for example if you applied for an Android position, only apply changes to the [Android](https://github.com/sumup-challenges/mobile-coding-challenge-take-home-task/tree/main/Android) project.

## The task

We have an app that displays a catalog of items for sale (Toasts) in a table. At the moment, the app just shows a white screen when launching it. We need you to complete the work and connect existing pieces! 

### Task 1: Connect app to backend

We want to display the list of Toasts using our backend as data source. Finish the `NetworkClient` implementation, connect it to our `ItemsViewController`/`ItemsActivity`.

Once complete, the app should look like this:

<img src="Steps/STEP%201.png" alt="Step 1" width="200"/>

### Task 2: Add “Last Sold” Date and Display currency of price

There is information missing from the table cells: users should see the date when the Toast was last sold and the price should be displayed in the correct currency.

Once complete, the app should look like this:

<img src="Steps/STEP%202.png" alt="Step 2" width="200"/>

Note: The goal is that the date is human-readable. The format visible in the screenshot is just a suggestion, but it doesn't have to match exactly.

### Task 3: Add tests to `NetworkClient`

Write two test cases for our `NetworkClient` class: the happy path and the unhappy path. You may build on top of the existing `NetworkClientTests` if you want to, but you are free to approach the test cases in any way you see fit.

### Task 4: Display images in list

The table cells should display dedicated images - a circle with the ID of the Toast - for each Toast. 
* On iOS: we need you to connect the existing `ImageRepository` class and use it to display the correct images
* On Android: we need you to implement the `setIcon()` method in `ItemsAdapter.ViewHolder`

Once complete, the app should look like this:

<img src="Steps/STEP%204.png" alt="Step 1" width="200"/>

## Guidelines for the Challenge

- This app is not expected to be production-ready. 
- The goal is to provide the functionalities listed above.
- You are free to change the code in any way you deem makes sense.
- It is expected that you spend no more than 3 to 4 hours to complete all tasks.
